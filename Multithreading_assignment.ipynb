    " Multithreading helps in concurrently executing multiple threads by rapidly switching the control of the processor between threads. It is a technique in which multiple threads in a process share their data space with the main thread which makes information sharing and communication within threads easier and efficient. They may execute individually while sharing their process resources. Its purpose of is to run multiple tasks and function cells at the same time.\n",

    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources that they need in order to proceed. Deadlocks can occur when a thread holds a resource and then tries to acquire another resource that is held by another thread, which is also waiting for the first thread to release the resource it holds. This can result in a situation where both threads are waiting for each other to release the resources they need, and neither can proceed. Deadlocks can be difficult to detect and resolve, as they can be intermittent and dependent on timing and scheduling.\n",

    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously and the behavior of the program depends on the order in which the threads execute. Race conditions can occur when a shared resource is not properly synchronized, allowing multiple threads to access it simultaneously. This can lead to unexpected and unpredictable behavior, as the behavior of the program depends on the timing and scheduling of the threads. Race conditions can be difficult to detect and reproduce, as they can be dependent on timing and other factors."
